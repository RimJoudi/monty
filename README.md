##The Monty language:
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. 

* The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

* In this project we will try to explain:
. What do LIFO and FIFO mean
. What is a stack, and when to use it
. What is a queue, and when to use it
. What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
. What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
. What is the proper way to use global variables
