* The Monty language:

  Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to      manipulate it. 

* The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

* In this project we will try to explain:
 what do LIFO and FIFO mean
 what is a stack, and when to use it
 what is a queue, and when to use it
 what are the common implementations of stacks and queues
 what are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
and what is the proper way to use global variables.
